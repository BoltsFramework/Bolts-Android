/**
 * This was created because the helper methods in {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} do not work
 * as people would normally expect.
 *
 * Normally, you would think that a cached thread pool would create new threads when necessary,
 * queue them when the pool is full, and kill threads when they've been inactive for a certain
 * period of time. This is not how {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool()}
 * works.
 *
 * Instead, {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool()} executes all tasks on
 * a new or cached thread immediately because corePoolSize is 0, SynchronousQueue is a queue with
 * size 0 and maxPoolSize is Integer.MAX_VALUE. This is dangerous because it can create an unchecked
 * amount of threads.
